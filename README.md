### 💬 About me
My name is Allen, as a child, I was taught that all problems had more than one approach to get obtain the solutions to them. However the main subjects taught in school usually had a predefined way of obtaining the answers to the questions. The closest subjects that allowed me to use creative methods were those that involved maths since it is possible  to use multiple formulas to solve one problem until I took an elective class on QBasic in high school. The first programming class that allowed me to come up with my own method to get the same end result as the other students. Ever since that class I decided learn more about programming and to be a program developer.
